## Features
* Prometheus v2.X.X
* InCluster deployment using a `StatefulSet` for persistent storage
* auto-discovery for services and pods annotated with `prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'`
* automatic configuration for RBAC
* preconfigured alerts
* preconfigured Grafana dashboards
* easy to setup; usually less than a minute to deploy a basic monitoring solution for Kubernetes

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes cluster and `kubectl` configured
* Security Groups configured to allow port 9100/TCP for `prometheus node-exporter` and 10250/TCP for k8s nodes metrics.

#### Optional
* SMTP Account for email alerts
* Token for alerts on Slack
* A IAM Role with EC2 ReadOnly access for EC2 instances monitoring. Only required for monitoring AWS nodes that are not part of the kubernetes cluster



## Pre-Deployment

Clone repository

    git clone github.com/camilb/prometheus-kubernetes && cd prometheus-kubernetes/basic

Make any desired configuration changes in `configmaps` according to your setup.
* ./k8s/prometheus/prometheus.cm.yaml
* ./k8s/prometheus/alertmanager.cm.yaml


## Deploy Prometheus, Alertmaneger, Node Exporter, Grafana and Kube State Metrics

    ./init.sh

* The init script will ask some basic questions and attempt to auto-discover information about your system.


Now you can access the dashboards locally using `kubectl port-forward`command, creating a ingress or a LoadBalancer. Please check the `./tools` directory to quickly configure a ingress or proxy the services to localhost.

To remove everything, just execute the `./remove.sh` script.
